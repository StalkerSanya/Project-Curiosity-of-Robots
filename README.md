- To add new reward, I added my code in evolutionary algorithm: file 'salimans.py' and also in file 'policy.py'. Also I highlighted my code in files 'salimans.py' and 'policy.py' with comments: 
```

- In folder xdpole above results of train evolutionary algorithm with curiosity are consisted
--------------------
- Result of train with seeds 13 ([ADAPT] 20 maxmsteps), 14 ([ADAPT] 1 maxmsteps):
 ![Plot Statistic](https://github.com/StalkerSanya/Project-Curiosity-of-Robots/blob/master/xdpole/figure_2.png)
 
 How we can see from plot above, it is not enough to set 1 maxsteps and also i case 20 maxteps our reward until not so big. So we need more time to train and set maxsteps minimum 100, I think.
